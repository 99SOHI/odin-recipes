    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Someone made this up and someone's husband and kids loved it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ shallot, finely diced</li>
      <li>½ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 ounces goat cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallot
        until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour balsamic vinegar into skillet
        and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until balsamic
        vinegar mixture is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Stir often.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut chicken breasts from one side through the middle horizontally to
        within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread
        them out like an open book.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half the goat cheese onto one half of each chicken breast and
        drizzle 1/3 of the reduced balsamic vinegar mixture over the goat
        cheese. Close the chicken breasts over the goat cheese and secure with
        toothpicks. Arrange chicken into a baking dish. Drizzle with remaining
        1/3 of the balsamic reduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink inside,
        the filling is hot, and the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An
        instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a filled
        breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
