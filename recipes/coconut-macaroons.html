    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Nutty, sweet, and exactly what you expect from a coconut macaroon! The
      texture is crispy on the outside and somewhat sticky and chewy on the
      inside. The chocolate adds a nice bitterness that cuts through the
      sweetness. These are so easy to prepare and would make great gifts, plus,
      they're easy to freeze!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) package sweetened flaked coconut</li>
      <li>⅔ cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
      <li>8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C) for 10 minutes.
        Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the air fryer basket, leaving 1
        inch on each side to use as handles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix coconut, condensed milk, salt, and vanilla together in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites in a medium bowl with an electric mixer with a whisk
        attachment on medium-high speed until stiff peaks almost form, about 90
        seconds. Fold egg whites into the coconut mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, spoon level tablespoons of the coconut mixture into
        rounds and place on the parchment paper, about 6 at time. Carefully
        transfer the parchment with coconut rounds into the air fryer basket.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until golden brown and set, 9 to 10 minutes. Remove parchment from
        basket, transfer macaroons to a wire rack, and repeat the process with
        remaining coconut mixture using the same piece of parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Microwave chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl on high power for 30
        seconds, then stir. Continue microwaving and stirring in 30 second
        increments, until melted and smooth, about 90 seconds total.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip flat bottoms of macaroons into melted chocolate and transfer to a
        parchment-lined baking sheet to set. Let rest until chocolate firms,
        about 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
